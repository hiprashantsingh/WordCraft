🚀 WordCraft | Advanced Word Counter Tool
Built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

🔹 Project Overview
Introducing WordCraft — a sleek and modern Advanced Word Counter Tool designed and developed by me, Prashant Singh, using a full-stack approach with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This isn’t just another basic word counter — it’s a productivity-focused tool built for writers, students, bloggers, and content creators who want real-time insights into their writing.

🔹 Core Features & Functionalities

✅ Real-Time Word & Character Count
The tool instantly updates the word and character count as the user types, making it highly interactive and responsive.

✅ Live Typing Experience
Optimized for smooth typing with a clean layout and responsive formatting to enhance overall user experience.

WordCraft includes light/dark mode toggling for better accessibility and user comfort — especially useful for long writing sessions.

✅ Data Persistence (Planned/Coming Soon)
Optional autosave functionality using local storage or backend integration to store and retrieve user inputs and analytics.

✅ Responsive Design
Thanks to carefully crafted CSS, the UI adjusts beautifully across all screen sizes — desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

✅ Clean & Scalable Code
From semantic HTML to modular JavaScript, the codebase is clean, maintainable, and ready for future scalability.
