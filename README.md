# WordCraft
🚀 WordCraft | Advanced Word Counter Tool – Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

🔹 Project Overview:
Introducing WordCraft, a sleek and modern Advanced Word Counter Tool designed and developed by me – Prashant Singh, using a full-stack approach combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB. This isn't just a simple word counter — it's a productivity-focused tool built for writers, students, bloggers, and content creators who want real-time insights into their text inputs.

🔹 Core Features & Functionalities:

✅ Real-time Word & Character Count:
As soon as the user types, the tool instantly updates the word and character count, making it highly interactive and responsive.

✅ Live Typing Experience:
The text area is optimized for smooth typing, with clear formatting and responsive layout, enhancing the overall user experience.

✅ Dark Mode Enabled:
WordCraft supports light/dark mode for better accessibility and user comfort, especially during long typing sessions.

✅ Data Persistence with MongoDB:
User text inputs and analytics can be optionally stored and retrieved using a MongoDB backend, enabling a smart autosave system and future analytics.

✅ Responsive Design:
Thanks to carefully crafted CSS, the tool adjusts beautifully across devices – desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.

✅ Built with Clean & Scalable Code:
Every line of code, from HTML structure to JavaScript logic, is written keeping modularity and scalability in mind.

👨‍💻 Tech Stack Used:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
Tools: VS Code, GitHub, Netlify/Render for deployment

💡 Learning Outcome:
This project helped me dive deeper into the DOM, Event Handling, Responsive UI design, and MongoDB database integration. It also gave me real-world experience in solving user-centric problems and creating a clean, engaging UI/UX.


🔚 Final Thoughts:
WordCraft is a perfect example of how simple ideas can be turned into meaningful tools with the right combination of frontend and backend technologies. This project is not only functional but also production-ready with future possibilities like login systems, keyword density analysis, export features, and AI writing assistants.
